# Q Learning Algorithm


## AIM
To develop a Python program to find the optimal policy for the given RL environment using Q-Learning and compare the state values with the Monte Carlo method.

## PROBLEM STATEMENT
To find the optimal policy for the RL environment using Q-Learning algorithm

## Q LEARNING ALGORITHM
### Step1:
Initialize Q-values for all state-action pairs and set up epsilon and alpha decay schedules.

### Step2:
For each episode, select actions using an epsilon-greedy policy and update Q-values using the TD error.

### Step3:
Track policy and Q-values after each episode, then compute the value function and derive the final policy.
